The CSS code defines the styling for a card component with a header, section and footer. The colors used for the design are shades of dark blue, white, and soft violet. The fonts used are 'Inter' for the header and 'Lexend Deca' for the section.

The card has a fixed height and width with a dark blue background color. It contains an image banner with a violet overlay, which is positioned on the left side of the card in smaller screens and on the top in larger screens. The header includes a main heading with a span tag in violet color. The section includes a paragraph and a list of statistics with a white font color.

The CSS code also includes media queries for larger screens, where the card's layout changes to a row and the header and section are aligned to the left side of the card. The statistics are aligned in a row and there is more space between the elements.
